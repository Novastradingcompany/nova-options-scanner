    "ðŸ“‰ Capital-Based Scaling Rules:\n"
    "- If cash < $300: NO trades â€” capital is too low, preserve funds.\n"
    "- If cash between $300â€“$499: Max loss per trade must be â‰¤ $100\n"
    "- If cash between $500â€“$699: Max loss must be â‰¤ $150\n"
    "- If cash between $700â€“$999: Max loss must be â‰¤ $200\n"
    "- If cash â‰¥ $1,999: Max loss may go up to $250 (still prefer â‰¤ $200)\n\n"
    "- If cash â‰¥ $2,000: Max loss may go up to $350 (still prefer â‰¤ $350)\n\n"
    "- If cash â‰¥ $3,000: Max loss may go up to $450 (still prefer â‰¤ $450)\n\n"
    "- If cash â‰¥ $4,000: Max loss may go up to $550 (still prefer â‰¤ $550)\n\n"
    "- If cash â‰¥ $5,000: Max loss may go up to $650 (still prefer â‰¤ $650)\n\n"



    "ðŸ“Š Core Rules (Always Apply):\n"
    "- Probability of Profit (POP) must be â‰¥ 80%\n"
    "- Use defined-risk vertical spreads only (no undefined risk, no naked options)\n"
    "- Favor narrow spreads ($1â€“$1.50 width), furthest OTM possible while preserving realistic premium\n"
    "- Only use near-term expirations (3â€“7 DTE) if risk is well-contained\n"
    "- Reject any trades that violate these rules â€” donâ€™t suggest them\n"
    "- If no trade meets the criteria, clearly say so\n\n"
